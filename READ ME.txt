ABSTRACT: 
Origami has the potential to impact numerous areas of design and manufacturing. Modeling 
and analysis of origami structures allow for the understanding of their behavior and the 
development of computational tools for their design. Most available origami models are 
limited to the idealization of folds as creases of zeroth-order geometric continuity, 
which is not proper for origami structures having non-negligible fold thickness or with 
maximum curvature at the folds restricted by material limitations. Structural analysis of 
origami sheets having creased folds requires further idealizations of the fold mechanical 
response such as the representation of the folds as torsional springs. In view of this, a 
novel model analogous to that for rigid origami is presented in this work for origami 
structures having folds of non-zero surface area that exhibit higher-order geometric 
continuity (termed smooth folds). This origami model allows for a proper structural 
analysis of origami sheets using plate or shell representations for the folds. The shape 
formulation of the smooth folds and the kinematic constraints on their associated shape 
variables are presented. Modeling of origami structures with smooth folds exhibiting 
elastic behavior is performed by determining the configuration of the structure that 
minimizes its total potential energy subject to the derived kinematic constraints. The 
presented results show that the structural response determined using the proposed model is 
in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.
